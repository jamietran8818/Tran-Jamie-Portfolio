# Data Science Portfolio
## By: Jamie Tran 
Hello there! The following portfolio showcases 10 projects I have completed throughout my Masters Program majoring in Data Science. I have chosen the following works to demonstrate my knowledge using a variety of languages, programs and techniques. 

# Project One: Python Weather App 
This was my final project of my Introduction to Python course. My code has built a working weather app which draws the local forecast from entering the zip code or city and state of the area you are interest in. This program draws its information from the OpenWeatherMap API.

# Project Two: SQLite Commands
Basic SQL commands were performed to parse through a dataset.

# Project Three: Movie Recommendation System
This program will recommend similarly rated movies to the user based on the title that is entered. The program will also cater to specific users and recommend movies to them based on movies they have reviewed in the past

# Project Nine: Time Series/Forecasting Model
In this project I am using a year of sales data from a pizza parlor to build a forecast for the following year using a SARIMAX model.

# Project Ten: Ridge Regression 
This project uses ridge regression to predict the outlook of Google, Apple, and Tesla stocks to help build sentiment analysis.
