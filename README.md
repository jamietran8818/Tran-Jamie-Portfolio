# Data Science Portfolio
## By: Jamie Tran 
Hello there! The following portfolio showcases 10 projects I have completed throughout my Masters Program majoring in Data Science. I have chosen the following works to demonstrate my knowledge using a variety of languages, programs and techniques. 

# Project One: Python Weather App 
This was my final project of my Introduction to Python course. My code has built a working weather app which draws the local forecast from entering the zip code or city and state of the area you are interest in. This program draws its information from the OpenWeatherMap API.

# Project Two: SQLite Commands
Basic SQL commands were performed to parse through a dataset.

# Project Three: Movie Recommendation System
This program will recommend similarly rated movies to the user based on the title that is entered. The program will also cater to specific users and recommend movies to them based on movies they have reviewed in the past 

# Project Four: Python Visualizations
In this code I created 4 different visualizations from two different datasets using python.

# Project Five: K-means Analysis in Rstudio
In this project I am working in Rstudio to perform K-means analysis which includes clustering visualizations, as well as identifying specific clusters and their sizes. 

# Project Six: Rstudio Visualizations
In this project I created 3 different visualizations from a data set using R. 

# Project Seven: Hadoop-Hive-Spark-Hbase
This section contains screenshots of my work in the terminal utilizing google cloud and exploring these different databases.

# Project Eight: Logistic Regression Model
In this project logistic regression is performed on heart disease data to categorize characteristics of heart disease amongst paitents. 

# Project Nine: Time Series/Forecasting Model
In this project I am using a year of sales data from a pizza parlor to build a forecast for the following year. 

# Project Ten: DSC680 Project 3 
This is reserved for my last project in DSC 680.
